# Re-thread
A web platform for upcycling and creative fashion, connecting consumers with artists to transform clothing sustainably.
Team codeblooded – Devika Shankar D, Devabhadra K U, Devanantha A R

# The Problem
Fast fashion is destroying our planet:
85% of textiles end up in landfills annually
92 million tons of textile waste per year globally
Average consumer discards 81 pounds of clothing annually
Synthetic fabrics take 200+ years to decompose

The Gap: Sustainable fashion feels boring and inaccessible. Young consumers want eco-friendly options that don't sacrifice style, but there's no centralized platform connecting upcycling artists with consumers.
